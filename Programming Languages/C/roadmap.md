Here, a list of the main C components and feature, listed more or less by difficul level (first easier , last more advanced).
Keep in mind that this list if not just by 'topic' but some point are just specified to take your attention of a particula feature
of the language that is controversial, different, unexpected or simply requires more attention (hence, need to be studied!).
