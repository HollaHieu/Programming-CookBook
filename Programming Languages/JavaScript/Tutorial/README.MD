#### Conditional (ternary) operator


- [Conditional Operator ( ? : )](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-conditional-operator)

The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the if statement.


#### Template Literals or Template String (prior editions of the ES2015 specification.)

*Template literal uses backticks.*

```
`\`` === '`' // --> true
```

* Multiline string: a string that can span multiple lines.

* String formatting: the ability to substitute part of the string for the values of variables or expressions. This feature is also called string interpolation.

* HTML escaping: the ability to transform a string so that it is safe to include in HTML.
