# The full text of the license is a lot to format cleanly in a text variable, and actual variables in every single module may be overkill. One solution:

# __copyright__ contains the copyright line (copyright owner, date and boilerplate text).

# __license__ contains the copyright line plus the short text that would go at the top of each source-code file (what appears in __copyright__ in the question). It can also be a short name or standard abbreviation for the license if the package will be handled by an automated system that automatically extracts license metadata from this variable or if you want the license name along with the copyright text and don't want or need the more verbose short text.

# The full text of the license is included as package data or a data file, accessed via pkg_resources and displayed via a button in the About dialog or a menu item under the Help menu for graphical applications. Plain text and HTML are convenient formats for the license text for this purpose. Not only does this avoid huge chunks of text in source-code files, it avoids having duplicate full license text in the source code and in a file in the documentation directory with the README and related files.
