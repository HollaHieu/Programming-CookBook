Part -2 - Iteration & Generators
=======================


## Features

* **Four iteration contexts in the Python language**

Iteration contexts in Python include:

* the for loop 
* list comprehensions
* he map built-in function 
* the in membership test expression
* the built-in functions: sorted, sum, any, and all. 


This category also includes the list and tuple built-ins,
string join methods, and sequence assignments, all of which use the iteration protocol
(see answer #1) to step across iterable objects one item at a time.
