## Features


### NOTES

- [Constant folding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding)

Constant folding and constant propagation are related compiler optimizations used by many modern compilers.[1] An advanced form of constant propagation known as sparse conditional constant propagation can more accurately propagate constants and simultaneously remove dead code.

- [Constant Folding](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rco/vignettes/opt-constant-folding.html)

Constant folding is an optimization technique that eliminates expressions that calculate a value that can already be determined before code execution. These are typically calculations that only reference constant values or expressions that reference variables whose values are constant.
