# Flask-Admin - Simple Views
=============================

#### Taken from [Flask-Admin Docs](#https://github.com/flask-admin/flask-admin/tree/master/examples/simple)



This example shows how to add some simple views to your admin interface. The views do not have to be associated to any of your models, and you can fill them with whatever content you want.


By adding custom views to the admin interface, they become accessible through the navbar at the top.
