# Flask-Admin - Boostrap4
=============================

#### Taken from [Flask-Admin Docs](#https://github.com/flask-admin/flask-admin/tree/master/examples/bootstrap4)


This example shows how you can customize the look & feel of the admin interface. This is done by overriding some of the built-in templates.




As for now, there is no release for bootstrap4, so you need to install it from the repo or similiar. 

```

pip install git+https://github.com/flask-admin/flask-admin.git

```
