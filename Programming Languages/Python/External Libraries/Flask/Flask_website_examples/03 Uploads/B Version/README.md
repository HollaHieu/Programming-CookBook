# flask-pic-uploader
Simple Flask App for uploading picture in a database and retrieve them  

## Updates

I will update this repository with more content.

I am planning to use an instance with flask_wtf 
One instance with SQLite 3 vanilla 


## To Do 

Need to develop a better and secure System anty-hacker for uploading the pictures.

### NOTE

Initially I wanted to use flask_uploads however it seems that is not longer supported with the new Werkzeug version (last working version is Werkzeug==0.16.0
