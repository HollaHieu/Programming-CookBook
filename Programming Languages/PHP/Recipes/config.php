    The important thing to realize is that the config file should be included in every
    page of your project, or at least any page you want access to these settings.
    This allows you to confidently use these settings throughout a project because
    if something changes such as your database credentials, or a path to a specific resource,
    you'll only need to update it here.
    -------------------------------------


    This is a basic drop-in config file. A multi-dimensional array serves as a flexible structure for accessing various config items such as database credentials.

db — Store database credentials or other data pertaining to your databases.
paths — Commonly used paths to various resources for your site.
log files
upload directories
resources
urls — Storing urls can be really handy when referencing remote resources throughout your site.
emails — Store debugging or admin emails to use when handling errors or in contact forms.
Using constants for commonly used paths makes include statements (require or include) a breeze, and if the path ever changes you'll only need to update it in one place.
