Onboarding checklist
---------------------

**Review these first time user experience principles. Use these as a checklist when incorporating new ways to engage users into your app.**

* Consistent imagery and recurring themes 
* Showcasing the premium option early (coupled with a free trial).
* Removing distractions (progressive disclosure).
* Celebrating progress.
* Unlocking more content based upon activity.
* Setting expectations and getting commitment.



* Build in a ‘time spent’ feature that gives users the option to see how their usage fluctuates over time. This gives users additional insights into their habits.
* Provide this information in a way that doesn’t interrupt the user flow.
* Consider adding user-initiated reminders with customizable timers and messages.


### monetization 

* Define a core set of features that will serve as your free baseline for all your users across time.
* Depending on your monetization model, decide which additional features will be IAP or a part of a subscription plan.
* When launching a subscription plan, evaluate your pricing and promotional strategy alongside the right billing period options relevant to your category.
* Test new features with users before release in order to understand their appeal and decide their price points or subscription tier placement.
* For subscriptions, balance the depth of entry level compared to renewals. Many loyal users might not feel fully appreciated when they see heavy discounts for newcomers and might cancel for the sake of a better deal.
* Highlight the value of content and features. Periodically remind users about the full list of benefits of their plan or purchases.
