 The term CDATA is used about text data that should not be parsed by the XML parser.

    Characters like "<" and "&" are illegal in XML elements.

    "<" will generate an error because the parser interprets it as the start of a new element.

    "&" will generate an error because the parser interprets it as the start of an character entity.

    Some text, like JavaScript code, contains a lot of "<" or "&" characters. To avoid errors script code can be defined as CDATA.

    Everything inside a CDATA section is ignored by the parser.

    A CDATA section starts with "<![CDATA[" and ends with "]]>":

<!-- 

<script>

    <![CDATA[
    function matchwo(a,b) {
        if (a < b && a < 0) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
]]>

</script>


-->


<!-- 

Notes on CDATA sections:

A CDATA section cannot contain the string "]]>". Nested CDATA sections are not allowed.

The "]]>" that marks the end of the CDATA section cannot contain spaces or line breaks.
